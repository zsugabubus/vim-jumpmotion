# vim-jumpmotion

Not actually Vim but NeoVim. I had enough of the limitations of Vim. God save
me from messing with undo history again but in exchange I had to live together
with buggy conceals. Nah.

This branch contains code driven by the exact same ideas found on `conceal` and
`master` branches. As a bonus, it supports targeting any windows.

This is what I use as a daily driver.
